## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Imagine an app or website where you can easily find places to recycle your old electronics like phones, TVs, and computers. You type in your address, and it shows nearby locations that accept e-waste.

This would be good for the environment because e-waste can be dangerous if it's thrown away in regular trash.  By recycling them properly, we can reduce pollution and conserve resources.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

Components:

User Interface (UI): This can be a mobile app or website for user interaction.
API Gateway: This acts as a single entry point for all API requests, managing security and routing to backend services.
User Management Service (Optional): This service (e.g., using Firebase Authentication) handles user registration, login, and access control (if applicable).
Geolocation Service (Optional): This retrieves user location data with permission for a more targeted search.
E-waste Facility Database: This stores information about e-waste facilities, including:
Address
Contact information
Accepted e-waste types
Operating hours
(Optional) User ratings and reviews (if implemented)
Search & Recommendation Engine: This service takes user input (location and desired e-waste type) and queries the database for relevant facilities.
Mapping Service: This displays the user's location and recommended facilities on a map (e.g., Google Maps Platform or OpenStreetMap).
Data Flow:

User opens the E-waste Locator app/website.
(Optional) User creates an account or logs in (if user management is included).
UI prompts user for location (zip code or allows geolocation access).
(Optional) Geolocation Service retrieves user's coordinates or zip code.
User selects desired e-waste type (optional filter).
UI sends location data and filter criteria (if any) to the API Gateway.
API Gateway routes the request to the Search & Recommendation Engine.
Search & Recommendation Engine queries the E-waste Facility Database based on user input.
Search & Recommendation Engine sends results back to the API Gateway.
API Gateway forwards the results (list of facilities) to the UI.
UI displays a list and map of nearby e-waste facilities with details like address, operating hours, and (optional) user ratings (if implemented).

## Technology Stack

An E-waste facility locator can be built with a variety of technologies depending on the desired features and complexity. Here's a breakdown of a potential tech stack:

Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: These are the fundamental building blocks for creating a user-friendly and responsive web interface that works seamlessly across various devices. Frameworks like Bootstrap can further simplify the development process.
Backend:

Server-side language (Python, Node.js, PHP):  These languages power the server-side logic, handling user requests, database interactions, and functionalities like search and filtering.

Database (Cloud Firestore, MySQL, PostgreSQL): The database stores information about e-waste facilities, including location, accepted items, hours of operation, and contact details. Cloud-based options offer scalability and ease of management.

Optional Features:

Mapping API (Google Maps API): Integrates map functionalities to display facility locations and enable users to find the nearest one based on their current location.

Firebase: A comprehensive backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform by Google that can provide user authentication, real-time data updates, and cloud storage functionalities.

Additional Considerations:

Security: Implementing secure user authentication and data encryption is crucial for protecting user information.

Scalability: Choosing technologies that can scale efficiently as the user base grows is important for future-proofing your application.
