## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Imagine an app or website where you can easily find places to recycle your old electronics like phones, TVs, and computers. You type in your address, and it shows nearby locations that accept e-waste.

This would be good for the environment because e-waste can be dangerous if it's thrown away in regular trash.  By recycling them properly, we can reduce pollution and conserve resources.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

Here's a breakdown of a possible solution and architecture for your E-waste Locator idea:

Components:

User Interface (UI): This can be a mobile app or a website where users can enter their location.
Geolocation Service: This service will use the user's location data (with permission) to identify their zip code or city.
E-waste Database: This database will store information on e-waste facilities, including:
Address
Contact information
Accepted e-waste types (e.g., TVs, computers, batteries)
Operating hours
Search & Recommendation Engine: This will take the user's location and search the E-waste Database for nearby facilities that accept their specific type of e-waste.
Map Service: This will display the user's location and the recommended e-waste facilities on a map.
Data Flow:

User opens the E-waste Locator app/website.
UI prompts user for location (zip code or allows geolocation access).
User enters location data or grants geolocation permission.
UI sends location data to the Geolocation Service.
Geolocation Service retrieves user's coordinates or zip code.
UI sends location data (zip code or coordinates) to the Search & Recommendation Engine.
Search & Recommendation Engine queries the E-waste Database for facilities in the user's area that accept their desired e-waste type.
Search & Recommendation Engine sends results back to the UI.
UI displays a list and map of nearby e-waste facilities with details like address and operating hours.

|       User        | ----> | Geolocation Service| ----> | Search & Recommend | ----> |        UI         |
+-------------------+        +-------------------+        +-------------------+        +--------------------+

         | (Location Data)         | (User's Location)      | (Search Criteria)     | (List & Map Results)
         |                         |                         |                         |
+-------------------+        +-------------------+        +-------------------+        +--------------------+
| E-waste Database  |        | Map Service         |
+-------------------+        +-------------------+
Additional Notes:

The E-waste Database can be populated manually or by integrating with existing databases from government agencies or recycling organizations.
The UI can be designed to allow users to filter results by facility type, operating hours, or specific e-waste categories.
Security features should be implemented to protect user privacy and location data.
This is a basic architecture, and you can add complexity based on your needs. For example, you could integrate with mapping APIs for more advanced route planning or allow users to leave reviews for e-waste facilities.

## Technology Stack

An E-waste facility locator can be built with a variety of technologies depending on the desired features and complexity. Here's a breakdown of a potential tech stack:

Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: These are the fundamental building blocks for creating a user-friendly and responsive web interface that works seamlessly across various devices. Frameworks like Bootstrap can further simplify the development process.
Backend:

Server-side language (Python, Node.js, PHP):  These languages power the server-side logic, handling user requests, database interactions, and functionalities like search and filtering.

Database (Cloud Firestore, MySQL, PostgreSQL): The database stores information about e-waste facilities, including location, accepted items, hours of operation, and contact details. Cloud-based options offer scalability and ease of management.

Optional Features:

Mapping API (Google Maps API): Integrates map functionalities to display facility locations and enable users to find the nearest one based on their current location.

Firebase: A comprehensive backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform by Google that can provide user authentication, real-time data updates, and cloud storage functionalities.
